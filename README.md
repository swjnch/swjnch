ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!!I am Sowjany Chilaka. Welcome to my github profile. 

### About me 
:mortar_board: I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in Pharmaceutical Sciences and a masterâ€™s in nutrition services. My pursuit of analytics started while working on my thesis and Research Assistant for School Nutrition Programs during my masterâ€™s program. 

:bulb: My primary skill includes data wrangling, analysis, visualization, business analysis, and reporting. I am familiar with tools like Tableau, SPSS, Excel, MySQL, SQL server, and programming languages like SQL, Python, and Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). 

ðŸ”­ Currently, I am working on Danny Maâ€™s 8-week SQL Challenge where you can find different case studies that need to be solved using SQL. I have worked on an EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) project using Python with the NYC Street Tree Census data which can be found in the repository.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any kind of data projects.
